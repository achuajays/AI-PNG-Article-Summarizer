# Article Summarizer App

This is a simple Streamlit app that uses Hugging Face's Transformers library to summarize long articles. The app provides an input section for users to enter their articles, and a 'Summarize' button that generates a summary of the article. The summary is generated using the 'Falconsai/text_summarization' model.

## Usage

To use this app, simply clone the repository and run the `streamlit run main.py` file. The app will automatically open in your web browser.

### Example Prompt

The sidebar section provides an example prompt to give you an idea of the kind of content the app can handle.

### Input Section

Enter a long article in the main input section and click the 'Summarize' button to generate a summary.

### Summary

After clicking the 'Summarize' button, the app will generate a summary of the article.

## About

This app uses Hugging Face's Transformers library to summarize articles. It is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications for machine learning and data science. The code is open source and can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/achuajays/AI-PNG-Article-Summarizer

## Libraries Used

### Hugging Face's Transformers

[Hugging Face's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) is an open-source library that provides implementations of popular deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It is built on top of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) libraries.

Transformers provides pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for a variety of NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and more. It also provides utilities for tokenization and text encoding, which are necessary for most NLP tasks.

### Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is a Python library for building web applications for machine learning and data science. It allows you to create interactive prototypes of your apps in minutes. Streamlit is designed to be easy to use, with a simple and intuitive syntax for defining UI elements and defining the behavior of your app.

Streamlit apps are written in Python and can be run locally or deployed to the cloud. Streamlit apps are designed to be fast and efficient, and can be easily shared with others.
